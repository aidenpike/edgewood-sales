<h1>Concept</h1>
<p>
    Edgewood University has once again hired you to create a program for them: A sales manager for their musical instrument purchases. The program will need to access and modify a database, allow users to access a UI in order to purchase instruments, and allow administrators to access a UI to modify the item count and items within the menu.
</p>
<h1>Reason</h1>
<p>As a way to get more into inheritance and overall C++ practice.</p>

<h1>To-Do</h1>
This is more for me, but you're welcome to read it.
<ul>
    <li>An Interface class with admin and user tools (likely User and Admin objects)</li>
    <li>A subclass within Interface that is all console outputs</li>
    <li>A Processor class with processing functions that return data based on requests</li>
</ul>
